BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## About

BookBot is a simple project designed to help users analyze text files. It takes a file path as input from the command line, for example:

```bash
python3 main.py books/hello.txt
```

The program then processes the file and provides the user with the character count of its contents.
